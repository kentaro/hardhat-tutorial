# My Trial of Hardhat Tutorial

[Hardhat | Ethereum development environment for professionals by Nomic Foundation](https://hardhat.org/tutorial/)

Diffs:

* Use Solidity `0.8.13` instead of an older version.
* Use `dotenv` to retrieve secret data (an API key and a private key).
* Use NodeJS `16.14.2` because Hardhat supports relatively older version of it.
